# Surfs Up Analysis
## Oahu Climate Analysis
The purpose of the Oahu climate analysis was to identify the best locations to establish a surf and ice cream shop and more specifically temperature trends between the months of June through December. 
In this analysis, we took weather data from various weather stations in Oahu and through various times of the year in order to provide our stakeholder a conclusive analysis and sustainable business model. 
## Comparison of Data - June vs December
One of the obvious conclusions we can determine from this analysis is that the minimum and maximum temperatures are overall lower in the month of December versus June:
* June Min= 64
* June Max = 85
* December Min= 56
* December Max=83

Another conclusion we can make is though June is a warmer month, the temperatures seem to stay relatively warm and there isn't a major downward trajectory. 
The number of records collected from the stations in June vs December could in fact have a played a role in the final statistical analysis. Perhaps if we matched or increased the number of stations and recorded the temperatures for the month of December, we would indeed see very little difference. 

## Conclusion
All in all, Oahu is a mild weathered island year round and would be a great location for our stakeholder to open a surf/ice cream shop. For further and a more wholistic analysis, it would be wise for our stakeholder to look at average temperatures for the first half of the year as well; January through May. If this is to be a year round business, it would be in his best interest.
